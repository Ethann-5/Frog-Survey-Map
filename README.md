This project was undertaken in the hopes of creating an interactive map for Ecollaboration, a Sunshine Coast based conservtaion company.

This map is used with their frog survey data, this data has been collected since 2014 over a number of sites accross the Sunshine Coast & hinterland.

Ther are a number features within the map that include:
  A year selector scale, allowing the user to choose which years data to display
  Each site having a circle marker that changes in size and colour depending on the total counts of each site
  A "cane toad remover" which is a toggle to remove cane toads from the data
  A coloumn graph that shows the total counts of each site for any given year, that changes with the year and cane toad remover
  Each site having a popup menu that that shows each species found at a given site, species name, common name and a more info link that takes the user to the frogID website of the given species
  A layer selector in the top right that allows for two overlay options, one shoing road and location markers, and the other having a satellite image to show the areas vegetation.
